## Project Overview
This project leverages the power of the **ESP32 microcontroller** to create an advanced, fully customizable drone system. Built on a robust **330 frame**, this drone is equipped with four **1000KVA BLDC motors** paired with **8-inch propellers**, ensuring high performance and stability in flight.

## Key Features
- **High-Performance Flight:** Utilizes four 1000KVA BLDC motors with 8-inch propellers for exceptional thrust and maneuverability.
- **Robust Frame:** Constructed on a sturdy 330 frame for durability and stability.
- **ESP32 Integration:** Uses the ESP32 microcontroller for advanced flight control, sensor integration, telemetry, and IoT connectivity.
- **Open Hardware:** Fully open-source design allowing for easy customization, upgrades, and community collaboration.
- **Modular Design:** Supports the integration of additional sensors and modules for extended functionalities such as GPS, obstacle avoidance, and real-time video streaming.

## How It Works
- **Flight Control:** The ESP32 processes sensor data and controls motor speeds via electronic speed controllers (ESCs) to stabilize the drone.
- **Communication:** Wireless connectivity enables real-time telemetry, remote control, and data exchange with ground stations or mobile devices.
- **Power Management:** Efficient power distribution ensures optimal performance of both motors and onboard electronics.

## Technologies Used
- **ESP32 Microcontroller:** For flight control, sensor integration, and wireless communication.
- **BLDC Motors:** Four high-power 1000KVA brushless DC motors.
- **Propellers:** 8-inch propellers designed for optimal lift and efficiency.
- **Open Hardware Framework:** A fully customizable design enabling modifications and enhancements.
- **Additional Sensors (Optional):** GPS, IMU, and obstacle detection modules for enhanced autonomy.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Assemble the Drone Frame:** Build the drone using the 330 frame and mount the four BLDC motors.
2. **Connect Components:** Attach the motors to the electronic speed controllers (ESCs) and integrate the ESP32 flight controller.
3. **Flash Firmware:** Use the Arduino IDE or ESP-IDF to upload the firmware to the ESP32.
4. **Calibrate and Test:** Calibrate sensors, test motor functions via the serial monitor, and perform pre-flight checks.
5. **Fine-Tune Parameters:** Adjust control parameters as needed for stable flight.
